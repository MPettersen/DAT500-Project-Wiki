In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936\\xe2\\x80\\x931939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\\xe2\\x80\\x931939|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolloten 1984, p.54&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | year= 1984 |  page =1107 |    isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] cause from the [[Soviet Union]].

Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain]] influence as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[Agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as libertarian [[commune]]s.
